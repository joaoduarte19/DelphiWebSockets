# Not active anymore
Unfortunately I don't have time to support this project anymore. Also the websocket protocol has changed in the meantime, so it won't work with browser and other modern implementations. 

Please take a look at the free (but closed) 3rd party component:

# DelphiWebsockets

Now includes SSL, a demo echo client, and echo server.
Refactored types and constants, as well as allow header injection before starting the
WebSocket connection.
